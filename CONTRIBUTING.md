# Contribution guidelines

Thank you for contributing to this project! Here's a couple things to keep in
mind before contributing:
 - For documentation: nothing here, just make your PR
 - For fixes: [open an issue][new-issue] so it gets recorded and someone with
   similar issue can find an answer
 - For features: [open an issue][new-issue] so we can discuss if it stays
   within the scope of this project and we set some requirements before you
   spend time working on your PR
 - Pull Request won't be reviewed until they contain a description and pass CI
   workflows
